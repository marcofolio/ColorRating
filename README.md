# ColorRating

Source files for the article on [Marcofolio.net](http://www.marcofolio.net/) called "[*Colorful rating system with Xamarin.Forms and Custom Animations*](https://marcofolio.net/xamarin-forms-colorful-rating-animations/)" . It uses [Xamarin.Forms Custom Animations](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/user-interface/animation/custom/) in order to animate colors.

Because this is Xamarin.Forms it works on iOS and Android. Browse the code or read the article to get more information about how this works.
